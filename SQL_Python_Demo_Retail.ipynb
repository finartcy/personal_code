    "Some common key performing indicators in the sales sector includes:\n",
    "+  **Churn rate:**  The number of customers who quit doing business with a particular company in a given period.\n",
    "+  **Average Order Value:** The dollar amount spent each time a customer places an order at the point of sale. A point of sale can be at a retail location or online. The formula for average order value is simply Gross Revenue divided by Total Number of Orders in a given period.\n",
    "+  **Inventory Days:** The number of days to convert inventory into cash. Inventory days is calculated by using the Average Inventory Value on the balance sheet divided by Cost of Goods Sold multiplied by the number of days in a period."

    "## Common Table Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A common table expression is a temporary table this is created, used, and discarded upon completion of the SQL. Common table expressions are useful options to prepare complicated reports by breaking larger SQL queries into smaller queries by using a WITH statement to define a common table expression. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common table expressions are comparable to classes in other programming languages because they often contain multiple sets of instructions (similar to functions). While most CTEs are non-recursive, they can also be recursive to define queries that refer to themselves (which can be useful for hierarchal data). Below is one example of a common table expression used to calculate churn rate as it relates to customer loyalty programs."
